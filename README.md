Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy. For agriculture, the most important thing is water source, i.e. rainfall. The prediction of the amount of rainfall gives alertness to farmers by knowing early they can protect their crops from rain.

Exploration and analysis of data on rainfall over various regions of India and especially the regions where agricultural works have been done persistently in a wide range. With the help of analysis and the resultant data, future rainfall prediction for those regions using various machine learning techniques such as XGBoost classifier, SVM classifiers, Decision tree, Naive bayes classifier, Logistic regression etc.
